1. Creating a component
    function title() {
        return (content- heading, paragarh...);
    }

    1. We can return only one component at a time.
    2. You have to render the created component in the App() component which is the main componenet in teh form of HTML tag. -----        <Title></Title>
    3. But you can create a simple opening and closing tag and inside that tag you can write multiple components that you want to return.
    4. You have to store each component in the different jsx file, so craete a different file for Title component by the name Title.jsx
    5. Import and export the component -
        1. Export the title form jsx file by - export default Title
        2. Import title in the App.jsx file by - import Title form "./Title.jsx"
